## Kurukshetra Movie Review
 
Kurukshetra is a movie that has been made with a lot of passion and dedication by the makers. The film is a tribute to the late actor Ambareesh, who played the role of Bheeshma in his last appearance on screen. The film is also a celebration of the 50th film of Darshan Thoogudeepa, who played the role of Duryodhana with conviction and charisma.
 
The film is a visual treat for the fans of epic movies. The film has been shot in 2D and 3D formats, and has used VFX and CGI to create a realistic and immersive experience of the war scenes. The film has also used motion capture technology to bring the characters to life. The film has a rich production design, costumes, and music that enhance the mood and atmosphere of the film.
 
The film has a stellar cast of actors who have done justice to their roles. Darshan Thoogudeepa as Duryodhana is the highlight of the film, as he portrays the complex and conflicted character with finesse. He shows his loyalty, friendship, pride, ambition, and vulnerability with ease. Arjun Sarja as Karna is another standout performer, as he depicts the loyal friend and warrior with grace and dignity. V. Ravichandran as Krishna is the guiding force of the film, as he delivers his dialogues with wisdom and wit. Ambareesh as Bheeshma is the epitome of honor and duty, as he commands respect and admiration from both sides of the war. Nikhil Gowda as Abhimanyu is impressive in his debut role, as he shows courage and skill in his fight against the Kauravas.
 
The film is not without its flaws, however. The film has a long runtime of over three hours, which can test the patience of some viewers. The film also has some scenes that are repetitive or unnecessary, such as the romantic songs or the comic relief scenes. The film also has some inconsistencies in the script and narration, such as the portrayal of some characters or events that deviate from the original source material.
 
Overall, Kurukshetra is a movie that deserves to be watched on the big screen for its grandeur and spectacle. The film is a commendable attempt to bring the epic Mahabharata to life on screen, and to showcase the talents of some of the finest actors in Kannada cinema. The film is a must-watch for fans of epic movies and Darshan Thoogudeepa.
